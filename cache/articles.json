Post-Halloweekend. 7am.</span></p><p class=\"c0 c1\"><span class=\"c3 c2\"></span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Drunkenly taking the elevator to my humble abode, after a night of rambunctious ruckus, I noticed the elevator didn&#39;t stop at floor nine, or floor ten, nor eleven, not even floor 18! I was transported to the nineteenth floor of Warren Towers Tower B. </span></p><p class=\"c0 c1\"><span class=\"c3 c2\"></span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I exited the elevator and was met with the entire universe. I could see every color, every person, every tip(?); I was in the </span><span class=\"c5 c2\">Astral Plane</span><span class=\"c2 c3\">.</span></p><p class=\"c0 c1\"><span class=\"c3 c2\"></span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Here, I could astral project myself into any timeline, any place, any dimension. Who knew so much power could be revealed through a drunken night out and Tower B of Warren Towers 19th floor. I found myself overwhelmed with such power, what shall I do? I was at a crossroads, on one hand I could abuse my power; cheat on my exams, find out secrets YOU shouldn&#39;t know. But on the other hand, I simply don&#39;t do any of that, but that&#39;s never fun.</span></p><p class=\"c0 c1\"><span class=\"c3 c2\"></span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">So I decided to do the most ceremonious action I could do and bless my friends with my presence and kindness. I began travelling through the </span><span class=\"c2 c5\">Astral Plane</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;to touch tips with them. I found that they were all in better moods, they seemed happier, less burdened. My astral cock was able to take their pain away and bring them to places they&rsquo;ve never been. </span></p></body></html>",

Buttery-soft, perfectly oversized vintage leather jacket hanging in the closet? No one has insurance for personal belongings anyway, go ahead and take it! Does the club that rejected you always stock delicious snacks from H Mart?

Unfortunately, that means those white supremacists are probably a no-go, as are the campus Christian groups that love to stop you while you&rsquo;re rushing to class. </span></p><p class=\"c1 c2\"><span class=\"c3 c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">As always, exercise caution, and use your own discretion.
