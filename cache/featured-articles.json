I haven’t washed my bedding in months. Boston University is bleeding me dry, and each day I find myself caught between a rock (laundry) and a hard place (chai latte). The choice is obvious. I get a ding on my phone.</p>\n\n  <blockquote>“Ding!” it dings.</blockquote>\n\n  <p>Picture me– in bed. This old man who just followed me on Instagram certainly is. Probably a scammer. Maybe true love. Possibly a lonely, independently wealthy soul looking to spend the rest of his days financially supporting someone who exclusively posts pictures of herself in sunglasses and seasonally-inappropriate layers of clothing.</p>\n\n  <p>After methodically liking each and every single one of my posts, the man (<strong>Kenneth</strong>) sends a message. <q>Hello dearest beautiful. I would like to get to know you and send allowance of 300$ monthly.</q></p>\n\n  <p>Well, that sounds good to me. I send back a classic, tasteful back-of-knee fake cleavage pic. We don’t use AI for our catfishing around here. We do it purely for the love of the game.</p>\n\n  <p>He responds, <q>Beautiful send routing number and account number.</q></p>\n\n  <p>Not so fast Kenneth. Now if I'm to sell my body (knee), I’ll do it for the currency that I damn please. The one that best suits my current, desperate need for laundry money.</p>\n\n  <h2>Convenience points.</h2>\n\n  <p>Luckily the BU gifting system makes it easy, dare I say convenient, to get “parents, family, and friends” to digitally send you money in the form of convenience points. I’d say Kenneth is eligible.</p>\n\n  <p>Unfortunately, the next step requires giving Kenneth my BUID. But what’s the worst he can do? Turn in my missing assignments on Blackboard? Pay my 6-months-overdue fall tuition balance? Use Handshake™ to schedule a zoom call with my advisor? If that's what’s getting him off, hey… Kenneth is welcome to do all of the above.</p>\n\n  <p>I ponder how much money he’ll send over. Will he stick to our agreed upon 300? Give me a little extra to save for a rainy day? Or maybe he’ll appreciate the boldness of my fake cleavage picture and pick the auto-select option of 1500$.</p>\n\n  <p>You know, a normal amount to be transferred anonymously from someone’s bank account to cold, hard convenience points. Now, while I’m firmly a lifestyle columnist and have no interest in investigative journalism, I have a strange feeling that students' clothes aren’t the only things being laundered here….</p>\n\n  <p>But hey, that’s besides the point. Why shouldn’t a loving, wealthy parent or a strange digital old man give me 1500$ to use on overpriced vending machines, broken laundry machines, and CityCo sushi?</p>\n\n  <p>I’m getting ahead of myself. With only minor hesitation, I send the gifting link and my BUID number to Kenneth, awaiting the days ahead. Days full of fresh linens, chai lattes, and joy.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>",

No more are the days of chaos and appointing mortal beings with no superpowers. This week, President Trump used his imagination to break boundaries from the Oval office, appointing Mesoamerican God of Rain, Quetzalcoatl (pronounced quet-sal-coa-tal), as Head of the Department of the Interior. Coatl had been on hiatus since 1519, when he was responsible for scaring the Aztecs into believing the Spaniards were white colored Gods (this part is not satire, that’s actually real). Trump touted Quetzalcoatl for such a successful propaganda campaign and white supremacist fundamentalism.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now before I continue, I know you readers have no idea what the Department of the Interior does. No yea, you claim to love political satire but don’t know how the government works. Sigh. Lemme dumb it down for you. No, it doesn’t build IKEA furniture or put up decorations. It basically just manages our land, resources, and maintains trusts with Native Americans tribes. Unfortunately, Pew Research Center has rated this department as the “most boring department.” A perfect place to finally spice things up.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">As Head of the Department, Queztalcoatl promises that all of our sacrifices will not be in vain. His first plan was to take detained undocumented immigrants, and make the fight to the death against American citizens. The winner of the fight to the death would be deemed worthy of sacrifice to the Gods (again, this is real, I did my research). This would bring at least 7 months of rain, providing full harvests of maize. Wow! Sacrifices would have to take place somewhere important enough for the Gods. Quetzalcoatl proposed putting a guillotine on the Lincoln Memorial.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">The opposition response has been mixed. Former Speaker of the House and resident girlboss Nancy Pelosi stated that she is worried about sacrifices overall. “While I think it's good Trump hired an immigrant who is also indigenous, how will human sacrifice help my investment portfolio?” This appointment also comes with Quetzalcoatl’s initial statement: “Niuil noyuki ka anilitika okse teomeh nik in office” which translates to “Biden will be sacrificed first.”</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">His last announcement as a new appointee was to announce his deputies of the department, which every department is allowed to do. After being chosen so decisively, political experts predicted that the choice would calm politics, mainly a evangelical christian states man (white most likely), which would quell worries of a foreign, once believed dead, Meso-american god. However, in a shocking move, he appointed Lord Yama, the Hindu god of hell. Yama’s previous experience includes running the Gates of Hell Inc. for about 4,500 years. Despite his short experience as an executive, his record is fairly impressive in keeping hell working for so long.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:36pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">What will this mean for the interior of America? Well, the expert opinion is still unsure. But what we can expect from the Trump Administration is more appointments that are out of this world. Trump seems to have moved on from the sexual abusers, sexist, alcoholics, Oil tycoons, wrestling ceos’ concubines, and other bootlickers. In exchange, Trump's search for power has now reached mythical proportions. Stay tuned as the Pinky Toe covers this very real story.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span></span></p>",

      "content": "Rating Each School by How Good Their Track Runners are in Bed \nRachel Stern \n\n\n“I’m a runner I’m a track star” - Mooski\n\nI have a knack for sleeping with guys on sports teams. The only time I have ever caught balls was with my mouth. I hit a home run almost every weekend if you know what I mean. I have only ever hit cardio when riding is involved. I only run when I know a hunk is waiting for me at the finish line. Needless to say, I feel like I know Boston track stars pretty well. \n\nHere are my rankings of teams that have crossed the finish line: \n\n5. Boston College: UGH. NO. Boston College is only good for 2 things, football and hockey. Now THOSE MEN know how to do it. But their track team?? Those fake Bostonians have me faking it. \n\n4. Tufts: The good-boys of the track-sex intersection. They just want to be told they are doing so great. An inordinate amount of them are still in love with their Christian high school ex-girlfriends, but this makes them incredible in bed. While not kinky, they will kiss your forehead and blush at praise. \n\n3. MIT: Boyfriend Dick. The perfect Goldilocks porridge. With the right amount of stamina and size, it always gets the job done. Are my legs shaking after? No, this is a marathon, not a sprint. But am I always satisfied? Yes, it is a beautifully average experience. \n\n2. BU: Kinky sex. Yum. \n\n1. Harvard: I hate to say it, but Harvard is my number 1. This is a race that leaves me breathless, legs shaking, sweat running, blown away. I didn’t know that daddy’s money could buy you good dick, but maybe I should have known that. Every time I go to a Harvard track event, I know I am getting it good. If only their legs could outrun their ego. \n\nThere you have it!! These are the men that have run right through my heart and straight to my pussy. I have never been so good at running, but maybe I should give the long jump a try since I seem to leap to conclusions. Have I mentioned that I accidentally fell in love with each of these men throughout my time in Boston? Anyway… more updates to come! Next up: I’m going to shoot my shot with basketball teams. ",

Nor did I ChatGPT it, which editor-in-chief of <em>The Pinky Toe</em> Ava Carrel suggested I do when I called her crouched with my forehead pressed against the side of a stall in the CGS bathroom. (Some people have asked me, hey, why didn’t you call your doctor first? Why, as you wondered if you were experiencing ER-warranting heart palpitations, call the editor-in-chief of <em>The Pinky Toe</em>? To that I say, I refer to the most trusted sources of information in my most trying times, a level of diligent media literacy we all should strive for in today’s political climate.) Ava assured me that I wasn’t going to die, just “don’t have caffeine or something stupid like that.”</p><p>Cancelling my Brown Sugar Oat Milk Shaken Espresso on Grubhub, I took a deep breath and decided that if Addison Rae could make an appearance at Sweat Tour, I could make an appearance at a lecture I pay to attend. I went back to class, tremors in my hand but in a cool, trend-setting, feminist kind of way. <em>The Greta Gerwig of hand tremors.</em></p><p>As I sat dazed in lecture, I wondered – <em>why</em>? Why me, why now? What sinister forces, karmic or unrelated, were at play on this random Monday morning?</p><p>Then, it hit me. Only one man could be behind this: <strong>Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. himself.</strong></p><p>As decreed by the alleged worm in RFK’s brain (which I’m convinced is more of a <em>Ratatouille</em> situation but can’t produce any real evidence for), we lowkey don’t fuck with antidepressants anymore.</p><p>And you know what? <strong>Yeah.</strong> Because no one told me shit about the Mucinex situation, and there I was, emailing my Screenwriting 1 professor about the irony of using a software called “Final Draft” to write my screenplay’s rough draft (<em>not even clever. Not even clever.</em>)</p><p>Then I thought about it more critically. Of course this happens now. Of course – <em>that’s what they want you to think.</em> They want you to think, <em>“no one told me shit about the Mucinex situation, no one told me shit about the Mucinex situation, go RFK, boo antidepressants.”</em></p><p>To this I say, <strong>no.</strong></p><p><strong>No.</strong> If this is the America we’re faced with in the year of our Lord 2025, an America where we’re expected to surrender our NDRIs over one measly Mucinex-induced fit of hysteria, then we have to face it head-on. RFK and his soon-to-be-revealed worm farm are trying to scare you into backing away from your hard-earned, well-deserved meds. You did not go through Spotify Wrapped after Spotify Wrapped with <em>“Funeral”</em> by Phoebe Bridgers in your top 5 just to stop taking your antidepressants over a cough!</p><p><strong>Resist.</strong> Stand up for your rights, one Mucinex high at a time <3</p></body>",
